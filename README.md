# yii2-js-widget

This is an implementation of the simplest js/css widget for your Yii2 app.

NOTE: If your widget name is something like <b>yii2-js-widget</b>, then the namespace you use should be like <code>frontend\widgets\yii2_js_widget</code>, and the file directory should be <code>frontend/widgets/yii2_js_widget</code>, so its namespace and path could be properly handled by framework.
