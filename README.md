# yii2-js-widget

This is the implementation of the simplest js/css widget for your Yii2 app.

NOTE: If your widget namespace name is something like "yii2-js-widget", then the file directory within your "frontend/widgets" should be named as "yii2_js_widget", so its path "frontend/widgetsyii2_js_widget" could be properly handled by framework.
